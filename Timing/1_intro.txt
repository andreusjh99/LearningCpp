This section concerns the timing of C++ programs (or parts of it).

There are commonly two metrics we use: "wall time" and "CPU time".
Wall time:
    - refers to the "wall clock time".\
    - This is simply the total time elapsed during the measurement.
    - as if you measured using a stopwatch
CPU time:
    - The time the CPU was busy processing the program's instructions.

There are several methods to time. 
    Some of them measure both wall and CPU times, some of them only measure one.
    Some of them are OS-dependent.
    In this tutorial, we will focus on those that work on Linux.

Method 1: time
-----------------------
- Only on Linux
- Measures both wall and CPU times
- Only measures time for entire program.

This is not really C/C++ code.
Just write "time" before the command to run the program.
For eg.
    $ time ./MyProgram

Output:
    real 0m5.931s
    user 0m5.926s
    sys 0m0.005s

"real" means wall time and "user" means CPU time.
